# topography -- watering and draining the Earth, and other celestial objects

What the Earth would look like if the sea level suddenly changed?
And what would be the Moon, Mars and Venus with as much water as on the Earth?

This code output maps from topographic data of planets, where the color palette 
is defined such as the highest altitudes look like mountains (white or brown),
the intermediate altitudes like plains (green), and the lowest like water 
(blue or deep blue).

or directly see images in the outputs/ folder.

On the blog post, I also explain how to collect and pre-process data before
applying this code.
